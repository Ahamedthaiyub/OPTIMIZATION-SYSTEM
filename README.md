 # ABSTRACT
# RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM
# ABOUT
# Machine-learning-
In this reposit you can find different models built for a classification problem.


## open folder for the dataset & the python file. 
In this project we create a resource optimization system with the help 
of machine learning attributes and some deep learning modules and 
we also use API keys for time manipulation and for mapping the origin 
and the destination address . we also plotted several graphs using 
matplotlib , seaborn and chart_studio to make a better solution for 
the company . by this system we can improve our company better by 
predicting the future of the company . since it is much more easier to 
find the difficulties that particular company . we (tech freaks) has also 
mentioned the distance between the place and also routed with 
powerbi .I’m damn surely saying that this project will definitely 
helpful in the big companies also. we also used other csv files also for other companies like  google and other and that also we mentioned in the above file(HACKATHON 1,2,4) 
MODULES WE USED
In this optimization system we have used many modules like ;
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Chart studio
Skilearn 
Scikit
Keras
Time stamp
API key for mapping 
Numpy’s and pandas
## Predict employee attrition:

# Procedures: 

## 1. Understanding the business problem. 

Employee Attrition is a huge problem across industries and generally costs the company a lot for
hiring, retraining, productivity and work loss for each employee who leaves. Price and Waters, a
boutique data science consulting firm, is looking to build a Machine Learning model to predict
whether an Employee might quit. Using this model, they might plan human intervention to alleviate
the issues faced by the employee. The firm is also interested in specific features that are highly
indicative of attrition.
The company in a pilot program, recorded employee data. The company collected employee
performance data for some of the months randomly for each employee to understand it in the context of attrition.
The company wants you to predict whether an employee would quit in the near future, given the data and to discover features
indicative of attrition.


## 2. Converting into a data science problem. 

What can be done here is , we can build classification model weather the employee will leave or not with the given demographs.

## 3. Exploring the data.(EDA)

Explorating the given data like  the columns given by visualising or by getting the summary stats of the data.

Packages used here for this visulaization are seaborn, matplotlib. 

## 4. Preprocessing of the data. 

Preprocessing includes removal of un-necessary columns, filling the missing data & converting the data into appropriate changes.

## 5. Feature engineering. 

Using the existing columns to create new columns. 


### Techniques 

Using SMOTE to over sample the training data since the target variable is highly class imbalanced. 

## 6. Model building & Evaluation.

F1 score is used as the evaluation metric, so that it can balance both the classess.
