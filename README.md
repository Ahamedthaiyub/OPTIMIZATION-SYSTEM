 # ABSTRACT
# RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM
# ABOUT
In this project we create a resource optimization system with the help 
of machine learning attributes and some deep learning modules and 
we also use API keys for time manipulation and for mapping the origin 
and the destination address . we also plotted several graphs using 
matplotlib , seaborn and chart_studio to make a better solution for 
the company . by this system we can improve our company better by 
predicting the future of the company . since it is much more easier to 
find the difficulties that particular company . we (tech freaks) has also 
mentioned the distance between the place and also routed with 
powerbi .I’m damn surely saying that this project will definitely 
helpful in the big companies also. we also used other csv files also for other companies like  google and other and that also we mentioned in the above file(HACKATHON 1,2,4) 
MODULES WE USED
In this optimization system we have used many modules like ;
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Chart studio
Skilearn 
Scikit
Keras
Time stamp
API key for mapping 
Numpy’s and pandas
We TECH FREAKS are damn sure that this project will obviously
work
