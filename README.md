### Abstract

In this article, we present a resource optimization system that utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve the performance of companies. The system takes advantage of API keys for time manipulation and mapping of origin and destination addresses, and employs tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Chart Studio, Scikit-learn, Keras, Numpy, and Pandas to create a comprehensive solution. This project was completed as part of a hackathon in 2022, and its results are promising in terms of its potential to help companies predict their future and make improvements accordingly.

### Introduction
In today's competitive business world, companies face a range of challenges, from employee attrition to resource optimization. One of the most pressing issues for many organizations is employee attrition, which is a major concern for companies and often leads to significant costs associated with retraining and loss of productivity. To address this issue, a data science consulting firm has taken the initiative to build a machine learning model that can predict employee attrition, given the employee performance data collected by the company.

The goal of this project is to develop a resource optimization system that uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve the performance of companies. In addition, the system takes advantage of API keys for time manipulation and mapping of origin and destination addresses, which helps to provide a more comprehensive solution. Furthermore, the system employs various visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Chart Studio to better understand the data and make more informed predictions.

### Methods:

The first step in building this resource optimization system was to understand the business problem. The data science consulting firm collected employee performance data over a period of time, which was then used to build the machine learning model. In order to convert this problem into a data science problem, a classification model was built to predict whether an employee was likely to quit or not.

The next step was to explore the data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This involved visualizing the data using tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib, and getting a summary of the data to better understand the characteristics of the employees and the reasons why they may leave.

After the EDA, the data was preprocessed to remove unnecessary columns, fill in any missing data, and convert it into an appropriate format for analysis. This was followed by feature engineering, which involved creating new columns from the existing data to better understand the relationships between the variables.

To handle the issue of class imbalance in the target variable, the training data was over-sampled using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Finally, the model was built and evaluated using the F1 score as the evaluation metric, as this allowed for a balanced consideration of both classes.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this resource optimization system has the potential to be a valuable tool for companies to predict their future performance and make necessary improvements. By utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques, along with various visualization tools, this system is able to provide a comprehensive solution that can help companies to better understand their data and make more informed decisions. Although the project was completed as part of a hackathon in 2022, its results are promising and could have a significant impact on the future of business operations.
